# MyDevConnector is a project based on the one built in this udemy https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/
I didn't implement all features and the frontend code is highly different of the course one.

#Install
1) git clone https://github.com/kulturman/MyDevConnector.git
2) cd MyDevConnector
3) npm i
4) npm run client-install
5) Copy ".env.exemple" to ".env" and "config/development.exemple.json" to "config/development.json"
6) npm run dev
